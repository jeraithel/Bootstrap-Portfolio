                <p>I completed the <a target="_blank" href="https://bootcamp.ucdavis.edu/">UC-Davis Coding Bootcamp</a> last year and am making the transition back into a technical role after a decade of management. I am inspired to work for an organization that is growing and impacting the world. In my free time, I sail and geek out on local politics and land use policy. I'm an entrepreneur on the side as a partner in a software startup and in an established real estate company. I enjoy working, learning and being a better person each day.<br><br>My first career was petroleum engineering and I lived in the United Kingdom and Algeria working on enhanced oil recovery projects.  My second career has been managing medical offices and developing mid-level management and doctors. My third career and what I have enjoyed as a hobby and a small part of both of my previous careers is programming.  I've been an amateur programmer my whole life and have worked mostly in SQL, Perl and Visual Basic.<br><br>I'm currently the Chair of the Planning Commission in Folsom and I also enjoy giving back by serving on a couple non-profit boards and as the Chair of the Steering Committee for the Folsom Community Service Day. You can read more about me on my <a target="_blank" href="assets/JER_Resume.pdf">resume</a>.</p>
