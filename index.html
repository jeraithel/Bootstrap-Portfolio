                <p>I am currently enrolled in the <a target="_blank" href="https://bootcamp.ucdavis.edu/">UC-Davis Coding Bootcamp</a>!  I like long walks on the beach...just kidding.  I like sailing and also geek out on local politics and land use policy.  I'm an entrepreneur and split my time between three companies right now.  I keep trying to retire but I really suck at it.<br><br>My first career was petroleum engineering and I lived in the United Kingdom and Algeria working on enhanced oil recovery projects.  My second career, what I am doing now, is managing medical offices.  My wife is a naturoapthic doctor and I've helped her grow to 20 employees in 2 locations.  My third career and what I have enjoyed as a hobby and a small part of both of my previous careers is going to be programming.  I've been an amateur programmer my whole life and have worked mostly in SQL, Perl and Visual Basic.<br><br>I'm currently the Chair of the Planning Commission in Folsom and I also enjoy giving back by serving on a couple non-profit boards and on the Steering Committee for the Folsom Community Service Day.</p>
